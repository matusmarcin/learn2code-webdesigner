	<dt>I've spent the past two years looking for my ex-girlfriend's killer...</dt>
	<dd>But no one will do it.<small class="author">- Anthony Jeselnik</small></dd>
	
	<dt>Yesterday I accidentally hit a little kid with my car.</dt>
	<dd>It wasn't serious - nobody saw me. <small class="author">- Anthony Jeselnik</small></dd>

	<dt>I once went on a date with a girl where we went hiking...</dt>
	<dd>...and she gets bit by a snake in between her toes, and I had to suck out the poison... So she's dead.<small class="author">- Anthony Jeselnik</small></dd>

	<dt>When I finished high school I wanted to buy myself a motorcycle.</dt>
	<dd>Buy my mom said no. See, she had a brother who died in a horrible motorcycle accident when he was 18. And I could have his motorcycle. <small class="author">- Anthony Jeselnik</small></dd>

	<dt>Whenever I meet a pretty girl, the first thing I look for is intelligence</dt>
